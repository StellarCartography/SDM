# Sequence Dispersion Minimization (SDM)

How to search for repeating, but *not periodic* signals in data?

Like strictly periodic signals, if you have a sequence or pattern that defines when the signal repeats, we can search for them in time series semi-efficiently! So far we're exploring repetition governed by simple integer sequence patterns.

The more general question of "how to find arbitrary repeating signals" is hard (because it's a poorly stated question!)
